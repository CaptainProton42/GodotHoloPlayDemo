### ⚠️ Test Release ⚠️
### I am currently not able to test this plugin myself. Please let me know whether it works and report any issues [here](https://github.com/CaptainProton42/GodotHoloPlay/issues)! You can also contact me on Discord (CaptainProton#3749) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CaptainProton42) should you prefer. Thanks!

***If you want to take a look yourself or are just curious, take a look at the [GDNative source](https://github.com/CaptainProton42/GodotHoloPlayNative).***

### Instructions

* Download the contents of this repository (green "Code" button in the top right corner) and extract its contents somewhere on your computer.
* Make sure your Looking Glass is properly [set up](https://learn.lookingglassfactory.com/onboarding/).
* Open the project in Godot 3.x (I tested it on Godot 3.3.2.)
* A colored cube should display on your Looking Glass Portrait right away.
* If it doesn't, make sure the `Main.tscn` scene is open, click on the `HoloPlayVolume` node and try changing the `Device Index` setting.
* I added some debugging output to the console that should display the properties of your Looking Glass Portrait. Please include it in your issue reports.
